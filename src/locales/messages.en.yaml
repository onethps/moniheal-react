  After uploading certain documents proving the agent's qualification and after
  its confirmation by moderator, the user account receives status of "Insurance
  agent account". <br/> So how is the platform useful for the insurance agents?
  <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp; - Insurance agents have the possibility to post information
  about their insurance services. <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp; - They have the ability to
  create a list of provided services. <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp; - There is an ability
  to create private and group chats and to save there all history of
  communication. <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp; - Access to clients' electronic medical
  records related to insurance matters (with client's permission only). <br/>
  Requests for insurance support <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp; When potential client
  chooses your insurance company or you as his personal insurance agent, he
  sends you a request for insurance support, indicating what services or what
  information he is interested in.<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;In your personal e-office
  you will receive notifications about new insurance requests, listing all
  information about interested users.<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;If the contract has
  already been signed with your client, all information about its number and
  term of validity must be included and sent with application.<br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;You must verify the accuracy of the information and confirm the
  application. In case of incorrect or false information - you can reject the
  application justifying your decision.<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;If the contract has not
  been signed with your client, you can discuss the terms of it in a chat and
  execute the contract offline with the help of digital signatures (which are
  valid).

  This section contains the electronic database of patients and clients.
  "Patients" are people who have previously signed a declaration with a family
  doctor in person. Patients can find their doctors using the platform's search
  in order to send them a request to be the patient's family doctor. (Currently,
  the functionality of online electronic declaration is under active development
  and will be implemented in the nearest future.)<br/> "Clients" are persons who
  do not have an official declaration signed with this specialist as a family
  doctor, but use his services.<br/> The doctor can find the patient's profile
  using quick search. The patient's profile allows the doctor to: start a chat,
  view the patient's medical records (if he has opened access), leave a note for
  the patient, go to the sections "Patient Health Dynamics" and "Monitoring"
  (edit if necessary).<br/> In the "Requests" section, the family doctor
  receives applications from patients and can confirm or reject them.<br/> In
  the "Invitation" section doctors can send an invitation to the patient via
  e-mail or sms. Patients who register after receiving an invitation will

  In the “Patients” section, an electronic database of people who have signed a
  declaration with a family doctor is being formed. A doctor can find a patient
  card using a search. The patient’s card allows the doctor to: start a
  dialogue, see the patient’s medical archive (if he has opened the appropriate
  access), leave a note for the patient. In the "Requests" subsection, the
  family doctor receives requests from patients and can confirm or reject them.
  In the subsection “My invitations” you can send an invitation to the patient
  by e-mail. Patient's data, which will register after receiving the invitation
  letter, is automatically displayed in the "Patients" tab.

  People who are just feeling good usually don’t think about the processes that
  occur in their bodies. Only few feel the need to be regularly examined by
  doctors. Unfortunately the current satisfied state of personal health does not
  guarantee a man the same healthy condition in the future. A person can miss
  some first slight changes in general condition that might lead to a serious
  disease if not be cured in time.
